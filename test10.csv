That 17-year old’s words ignited a passion within Godfrey, one that lead him to his mission of imparting self-empowerment to pre-teens and young adults.Since 2007, Godfrey has been speaking at high schools, middle schools, colleges, counseling centers, juvenile homes, and churches, operating in his mission, and helping our youth and young adults to know that they possess a great power within themselves – the power of choice. The overall intent of Godfrey’s talk is to teach the students about how, in spite of them not being exposed to consistent examples of success, they each have a purpose on this earth, and that they can and will put an end to the generational cycle of poverty, unemployment, and crime in their families. These same social issues also affect affluent children, as well, especially with the increase of heroin use and overdoses in the suburbs.Godfrey joined the Los Angeles County Office of Education in 2009, where he serves as a Paraeducator, providing individualized instruction and planning activities for students in juvenile halls, juvenile probation camps, and teen drug rehabilitation centers. He previously worked at the North Valley YMCA in Granada Hills, CA for four years, working with children, ages 5-12. Godfrey has been teaching middle school classes at his church in Granada Hills, CA where he also created the B4Men mentorship program for boys, ages 11-14.Godfrey speaks to youth and young adults in a conversational manner that gets them quickly engaged and involved in each topic. He speaks to them on their level, and never with a condescending tone. By the time Godfrey is finished speaking, the impact he has made is apparent by the smiles in the room, and the notes that have been taken.Godfrey has an Associate of Arts degree in Business from the University of Phoenix, where he is also pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Entrepreneurship.As an actor, Godfrey has appeared in over 25 national commercials, including spots for McDonald’s and AT&T. He has also played numerous roles in hit television shows, such as How I Met Your Mother, Southland, and Cold Case. Godfrey knows how blessed he is to have the opportunity to fulfill his dreams as an actor, singer, dancer, and encourager. He attributes these opportunities to the choices he made when he was young. Godfrey thrives in knowing that he can lead youths and young adults to the choices that will make a difference in their lives, as well.

We cannot escape it so let’s embrace it. Doing change well is the essence of business success, bringing company culture, systems and people into attunement where people and business reach full potential together.And what better way to start the journey of change for people than with dedicated keynote talks - Change Anything™, Lead Anything™, Propose Anything™, Influence Anything™, Resilience Anything™, Present Anything™ - created by myself and business partner Julie Alexander at Changing Change International (CCI) and born from our signature model – Culture Incorporated™.

All you have to do is Plan, Communicate and Follow-up. It's the execution of those three things that most find hard. I turn your managers into leaders. A SIMPLER SYSTEM: 7 Keys to Inspired Leadership provides new and established leaders with the skills to plan, communicate and follow-up. This leads to staff accountability, retention, greater productivity, more profits and good fun at work.   I've found most people at any level of leadership don't plan well, find effective communication hard, and rarely follow-up fully. I know lots of times I didn't, so that's why I developed my program. I've had the pleasure of conducting workshops and coaching clients across Canada, in the United States and in China. And you know something, the problems are the same everywhere. Your business doesn't matter, we all have the same raw resource—people. You get work done through people and you get incredible work done when you have your act together. Simpler stands for:S - Self - I use the DISC Behavioural Assessment tool to introduce you to you. I - Inventory - What's working for you as a manager, entrepreneur, supervisory or CEO?M - Marketplace - What's happening in your industry, not just your business?P - Plan - Take time each week to truly step back, see the big picture and plan your next steps.L - Lead - Coach, delegate, mentor, and hold yourself and others accountable.E - Entrepreneur - You and your people are most effective when you think like entrepreneurs.R - Repeat - We talk about business cycles for a reason, repeat the process and have fun.I’m a Corporate Trainer and Professional Speaker with over 35 years experience in leadership and training.

 Matt,https://speakerhub.com/sites/default/files/styles/cover/public/Matt-Cubbler-cover.jpg?itok=4ksLyrGi,COO,Maxout,"Matt Cubbler has always lived a life of sacrifice and dedication to others. From serving in the U.S. Army, to working as one of Pennsylvania’s most renowned police officers, to donating his time speaking to teens and young adults about the importance of leadership in their lives, he has devoted his life to helping others through both his professional and personal life.To him these things come naturally. Because after growing up as the son of a single mother and the brother of a mentally disabled teen who was often picked on, Cubbler always knew it was his calling to serve others.A month after graduating from high school, Cubbler’s brother Andy died in a violent car accident.  That moment would end up becoming the single most impactful moment in his life.  While he excelled academically in high school and had an opportunity to attend one of the four major military academies, he decided he was needed elsewhere and chose to enlist in the United States Army and served for four years as an Intelligence Analyst. His Army tour of duty took him from Augsburg, Germany to the Persian Gulf War.  After leaving the military as a highly decorated soldier, Cubbler began his career in law enforcement.  Throughout his career, he has worked in almost every facet of law enforcement – uniformed patrol, investigations, under-cover narcotics, and SWAT.  Shortly after “9/11,” he answered the call to, once again, protect America against Islamic Extremists who were inflicting terror all over the world. He was one of only a few thousand select individuals (out of over 900,000 applicants) to be hired by the newly formed United States Federal Air Marshal Service.  In 2006, Cubbler returned to local police work and he published a memoir that detailed his life with his brother entitled A Brother’s Love: A Memoir.  In 2008, to help raise money for charities established in his brother’s name, he ran 78.8 miles across the state of New Jersey. His level of love and commitment to keeping his brother’s name and story alive has inspired thousands across the country.  In 2009, Cubbler got bit by the entrepreneurial bug and he launched his first company MaxOut, a unique fitness brand that owns a unique piece of patented strength training technology and owns and operates one-of-a-kind gyms utilizing this same technology.  Over the past eight years, while still working full-time as a police officer, he has built MaxOut into a national brand that has helped thousands of people achieve strength and fitness levels unseen in the fitness marketspace.  Today, Cubbler is still a full-time police officer, the COO of MaxOut and a sought after public speaker who captivates his audiences through his personal story of struggle and triumph, his leadership training program based on his experiences as a soldier and his law enforcement officer and most importantly his life living with his brother whose life and death has inspired all that he has accomplished since that fateful day.

That was a wake-up call that indicated there were some deeper issues in need of love, attention, and release - issues that medications, lifestyle changes, and medical interventions couldn't touch. It wasn't easy (she had to peel back the layers and really look into her Self) and it wasn't quick (it took years), but she healed. She believes there is a place and a time for doctors and Western medicine, but if you are 100% committed to healing all areas of your life, your soul is called to go on a journey as well. Now, Penny teaches the Therapeutic Meditation Process and the 10 Vibrant Body and Abundant Life Keys, trusting that they will find their way into the hearts and lives of those who need it, and who are ready to take the journey of discovery that lies ahead.

Debbie entered a world of poverty, racism, abuse, and family suicide. But after years of struggle and barriers that for most would be too daunting, Debbie succeeded in becoming a highly sought after speaker and comedian. Born in South Chicago during segregation, with a disabling birth defect - spina bifida. At five-months of age Debbie contracted polio. the eldest of seven children, her disability would not keep her from becoming self-appointed matriarch of the family. Over the years her mother had fallen into alcoholism and depression and her father was an abusive drinker. Debbie was educated in a school for disabled students where color was not a factor in her placement. Life was hard, but she still was able to laugh and dream. At eight she pushed through a crowd with her Dad and shook the hand of Martin Luther King. words from his speech ""judge people for the content of their character, not the color of their skin"" has always stayed with her. As a young mother, Debbie met the challenge. She would take her toddlers and groceries up to the third story of her apartment building one stair at a time alternating bags of groceries and babies until reaching the top floor celebrating her accomplishment with cheers. While still in Chicago she married a man, that like her father was abusive, nothing changed. She started a business with ladies in the neighborhood called ""Debbie's Dollies."" using brown fabric and discounted African American dolls heads they fashioned dolls that were sent all over the country; a few with a miniature likeness of her leg brace. In 1987 she decided to divorce her husband, take her children and move to Tacoma Washington. She moved to a tough area in town called Hilltop, but compared to the slums of Chicago, Hilltop was paradise.  Determined not to be a welfare mom she found employment the Washington State Lottery for 13-years until her speaking launched. now married to her second husband, Elliot. He fell deep into depression, committing suicide. Debbie knew life could not stop. Once again, she was the single income earner for her family. Her speaking career started a year later and she found herself moving uptown Tacoma.  As a member to Toastmasters, she began winning speech contest one over another. With her National win, she was able to open for the comedian Sinbad, who enthusiastically encouraged her to continue her speaking career.

A successful international investment banker with over 35 years experience, he has conducted business in Africa, Middle East, Europe and Asia. Committing his life to halting the continuing cycle of violence among the youth, Azim became a social activist after his 20-year-old son Tariq was senselessly murdered while delivering pizzas in January 1995 by Tony Hicks, a 14-year-old gang member. Out of unspeakable grief and despair, Khamisa was inspired to transform his loss through the miraculous power of forgiveness. Believing that there were “victims at both ends of the gun,” Azim forgave Tony and founded the Tariq Khamisa Foundation to break the cycle of youth violence by saving lives, teaching peace and planting seeds of hope in their future. A month after establishing the foundation, Azim invited Ples Felix, Tony’s grandfather and guardian, to join him. Together, since November 1995, the two have brought their story and message through TKF’s Violence Impact Forums. The duo has reached a half a million elementary and middle school children live and over 20 million via video programs, guiding the youth to choose a peacemaker’s life of non-violence and forgiveness.  Because of his powerful story and message, Azim is a highly regarded and respected leader and a sought after speaker nationally and internationally. Having given 600 keynote speeches all over the world – including an audience of 300,000 at the “Stand for Children” rally in Washington D.C. in 1996 – Azim has also received more than 65 regional, national and international awards.

The most successful companies have become adept at navigating change.  Effective leaders create companies where every employee has clarity about where they are going and why.     There are four simple, but powerful, questions that every leader should be asking to drive clarity and create an effective strategic navigation plan.     Employees don’t like change.  Bold leaders are willing to disrupt their companies, even when it’s unpopular.  They do it not for the sake of disruption, but because they see what is possible when others do not.  Gerry’s framework is powerful enough to create game-changing strategies, but simple enough that every employee will understand the vision and be excited for what’s next.     Gerry O’Brion is a nationally recognized marketing and branding expert who has worked on several billion dollar brands and distilled that experience into growth strategies you can implement immediately, regardless of your budget.

My name is Joseph Evans and I consider myself an originator.  Originally from Redwood Falls, I grew up with my mother and 3 siblings which I was the youngest of. I spent my time as a child riding bike through Ramsey Park to the pool.Without a lot of friends, I typically resorted to returning home for some time on my Super Nintendo. To entertain myself I developed a lot of hobbies over the years including the habit of destroying and fixing everything I could get my hands on.What started with Legos, turned into bikes, computers, skateboards, cars, as well as my very own life. This self-destructive behavior seems to have begun at about the age of twelve.By age fourteen I was in my first institute for “behavioral issues” and highly medicated. In 2006 I earned my first Felony conviction.Being institutionalized throughout the school year I dropped out and obtained my GED. Eventually being released and allowed to remain on house arrest for the duration of my trial, I was contacted by a National Guard recruiter. Returning to court they had agreed to drop the felony in Lou of my joining the military, as a combat engineer, specializing in explosives and building bridges.I returned from Fort Lost in the Woods Missouri with a certificate of completion for training, along with a Reenlistment Code of 4 from a failed drug test.I continued a miniature reign of terror on my own life by receiving a felony drug conviction for the sales of ecstasy in large quantities. I spent my first stay as an adult in a real jail cell commuting to Minnesota West’s Granite Falls Campus for the computer support and repair program. Having begun this prior to my stay at the county motel, it was a serious challenge to keep up, considering most of my work was either online or on a computer. After my stay at the Redwood County Jail I began working with my father who had contacted me after seeing me in the newspaper.  I developed 52 websites targeting every avenue of the Industrial Bakery Equipment Market. This was my first step back into a creative world.The time came to an end with my father’s company and I moved on to Marshall. Commuting to jonti-craft to make a living I needed to do something with my life. I saw an ad in the newspaper for a registration deadline at the university and enrolled that week. I opted into the Graphic design program being the closest thing to web development. I had been writing code since I was 16 and in my first 3 years of college I never saw a bit of it. However, I had gained a new perception on life, my definition of beauty, and an aesthetics in general. Between the clubs I’d been involved in, to the startup tech company that failed fast, I constantly added new endeavors to my plate.  Collecting experiences had become my new hobby.

 Jim,https://speakerhub.com/sites/default/files/styles/cover/public/Jim-Goldfuss-cover.jpg?itok=uzzQZASu,Professional Speaker,Jim Goldfuss,"I'm the guy to see when you're ready to break free...But I wasn’t always that guy. In fact, I was the one who spent most of my life imprisoned, not by a physical prison, but rather one created in my mind. Living a life full of “no’s and never’s”, of failures and disappointments.I developed anxiety and depression in my younger years and went through 33 years of my life not realizing it; I just thought that was how life was. Some people were talented and gifted, successful and self-confident, and some were not. I was one of the “not’s”. But after some significant life events, I not only came to recognize the obstacles I was facing, but also the challenges that lie ahead. That challenge transformed my life into a journey; a journey that has changed my point of views, my results, and my life. I am not the same person I was just a few years ago. I believe in my ability to do the things I never thought I was capable of, and I have done things I never thought possible. My challenges have given me a unique perspective, and my professional experience includes retail and logistics management as well as corporate training, and I have a keen focus on customer service. I have come to learn that the truths we cling to depend greatly upon our point of view, and by changing your perspective, you will see those obstacles and challenges as opportunities to grow and achieve success beyond expectation; to take a quantum leap in performance and results. Nothing in life is “coincidence”, things happen for a reason, and it is not what happens, but rather how you choose to respond to it that makes the difference and creates the environment you are operating in. Remember, if you don’t like the answers you are getting; ask better questions! And as I don't believe in coincidence, I also don't believe it is one that my information has found its way to you.Is now your time to break free? Let’s start the conversation and take that quantum leap; getting you the performance and results, along with the inspiration and motivation, to blast through any obstacles or challenges that arise for you or your team.

From his basement, he launched SoftKey Software Products. As sales took off, Kevin moved to headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and went on an industry consolidating acquisition binge.From 1995 to 1999 he bought out almost every one of his software competitors, including Mindscape, Broderbund and the Learning Company in the industry's first vicious public hostile battle. Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals.In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for a staggering 3.7 billion dollars, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O'Leary Funds. He raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors who share his ""get paid while you wait"" yield oriented, value investing philosophy. He shares his tips and tribulations with a national television audience and turns The Street upside down in the process.As a self-proclaimed ""Eco-preneur,"" Kevin looks hardest for investments that make money - and are environmentally friendly. When he's not squeezing the market from his office, he travels the world looking for new opportunities to deploy his capital. He is on the investment committee of Boston's prestigious 200-year-old Hamilton Trust, and is the chairman of O'Leary Funds. He also serves on the executive board of The Richard Ivey School of Business.He recently launched O’Leary Financial Group, a group of brands and products that share Kevin O’Leary’s guiding principles for business, including honesty, directness, and, above all, great value.Kevin escapes on weekends with his family to his cottage that spreads over prime Canadian wilderness on the shore of an ancient glacial lake.
