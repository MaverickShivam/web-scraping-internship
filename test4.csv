 Hope,https://speakerhub.com/sites/default/files/styles/cover/public/Hope-Bevilhymer-cover.jpg?itok=gwcexAaX,"Entrepreneur, Author &amp; Public Speaker",Malcolm Lemmons & Associates,"Hope Bevilhymer lives up to her name. She provides hope to those who have experienced limb loss. Hope had her right leg amputated below the knee, at the age of 25. Despite her own experience with limb loss, she advocates for those who have experienced amputation throughout the globe.    Hope Bevilhymer was born on a snowy night in December, 1976. She was born with bi-lateral clubfeet. The right foot was turned in and upside down. The doctors started stretching her foot at the age of 2 weeks old, followed by weekly castings. Her first surgery was at the age of 3 months. She continued with over 20 surgeries, stretching, casting, braces, gangrene, pain management, etc. At the age of 18, Hope had a leg lengthening procedure, called Ilizarov. This included metal rods through her bones, in which she turned daily, over a 2 year period of time, which lengthened her leg 2 ½ inches. The pain in her leg continued, despite all of the doctor’s knowledge, and all other options. In June 2002, Hope had her 30th surgery, to amputate her leg below the knee.    Amputation sparked a drive in Hope. She watched a documentary on landmine victims, and saw the “need” of people in developing countries. Hope founded The Limbs of Hope Foundation, in October 2003. The organization was started to collect prosthetics in the United States, and ship or deliver them to developing countries. Through her experience of amputation, she realized that people were just discarding the prosthetics, due to product liability laws, while developing countries could use the components.In October of 2004, Bevilhymer and two companions delivered the first 55 prosthetics in the Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh. In October 2006, Hope traveled back to Cambodia where her organization delivered more prosthetics and replaced a basketball court for individuals in Cambodia, who have experienced limb loss. In June 2007, Hope traveled to a Romanian orphanage where she donated prosthetics and brought sporting equipment for the kids.    Hope is an athlete she tried out for the USA Womens Para Ice Hockey Team in 2016 and made the roster. She is the goalie for the team and in 2018 her and her team won the gold medal in the World Cup Womens Para Ice Hockey Team. She is going to continue her hockey career until she receives a gold medal in the Paralympics.     Honors: March of 2005 Hope was the youngest recipient of the Volvo for Life Awards. Hope received 2 Honors for the Volvo for Life Awards. She received the Quality of Life Award and she was named Americas Greatest Hometown Hero as the grand winner of the Volvo for Life Awards.July of 2005 Hope was again the youngest recipient of the “Days of 47” Pioneer of Progress in Education, Health and Humanitarian Award.2018 Gold Medal winner in the Womens Para Ice Hockey World Cup.

She had both professional and personal pressures. Rashmi’s father came to the United States with just $8 in his pocket to attend school and achieve the American dream for the hope of a better life for his family. He obtained a masters degree and a doctorate degree in engineering and is now on his second career after obtaining a juris doctor and masters in law degree. In the Indian community, there is a strong desire to achieve good grades, go to the top schools, win awards, get hired by big companies, and make money.In addition to being a mother of two, Rashmi was a successful lawyer who graduated with honors from Columbia Law School. After working for several major corporations, she launched an independent law practice in Miami, Florida. During the housing boom, she was recruited to work with a local real-estate developer who later engaged in questionable business practices. Rashmi’s drive to succeed financially and to give her children the best life possible created an ethical blind spot for her. She chose not to question her client’s behavior despite her inner voice screaming “ask questions!” Her involvement resulted in a six month sentence to Federal prison, alongside a $19M judgment against future earnings, required community service hours, and 3 years supervised release.Before beginning her sentence, Rashmi’s community of friends and family embraced her. Though previously believing only a high level of success would make them proud, she now felt for the first time the true power of what building strong relationships meant. A close family friend remarked quietly “You will eventually learn that this is not happening to you, it is happening for you.”In prison, Rashmi felt shame and remorse for her decisions. Taking in six months of federal prison life, Rashmi came to a place of peace and self-forgiveness. While being immensely humbled by this life-changing experience, she emerged with invaluable lessons learned both personally and professionally. Rashmi shares her emotional development of living with remorse, but not letting it define you. She is determined to create a culture of conversation around ethics and compliance and to integrate ethics into all aspects of our lives.Rashmi continues to tour the country as a public speaker, sharing her story to illustrate the ethical perils that can result from a drive to succeed and the blind spots created when we are pursuing our goals. She mines her vast legal and business expertise and tells her powerful story to deliver game-changing messages to universities, law firms, corporate teams, and trade associations around the United States. Rashmi redefines what it means to be successful in an American culture where success is often obtained by any means necessary.

 Dave,https://speakerhub.com/sites/default/files/styles/cover/public/Dave-Cain-cover.gif?itok=ai_ROc7y,"High-Performance Strategist, Speaker, Consultant","Dr Karen Jacobson, LLC","Dave brings a diverse and unique set of leadership experiences to the discussion.  He has practiced and studied the art of leadership for 39 years, on three continents, military and civilian, union and non-union.  He has practiced leadership as a supervisor and manager in Fortune 500 companies for over 25 years. He has coached leaders from the front line to CEO level on how to improve their leadership results for over 11 years.He believes that all organizational results are attributed to leadership.  A key question to consider is how well leaders are prepared for the positions they hold?  How and where did they learn about leadership?  Formally or informally?  Effectively or just satisfactorily?  How objective are the traits that we ascribe to effective leadership?  If those traits can be identified, how well do we measure and develop them to help that leader realize continuously improved results?Many leaders in this day and age are focused more on results than on the process by which those results are obtained. This implies that the process is variable and unpredictable, as long as the result meets or exceeds expectations. How is this sustainable?  Many of those leaders succeed in the short term - by pushing people and processes beyond their design capability.  But if a leader could develop the skills to facilitate those people and processes for sustainable results, how much better could results be and how long could superior results be sustained?  The likely answer is 'indefinitely.'  A significant challenge faced by leaders is that they don't know themselves well enough to know how effective they really are as a leader.  And since few people are going to give them that feedback, we just hold on for the ride.  If you as a leader can learn enough about yourself and about effective leadership techniques, you can take your leadership skillset to an entirely  new level of performance. It is risky to get to know yourself - it takes courage.  It takes courage to admit that you may not be properly equipped to perform as an effective leader.  So an effective leader starts by working on themselves, then they can expect the organization to respond in kind.It follows then, that if a leader can learn to minimize hurdles and interference faced by him or herself, then address those faced by his/her people, they then have a right to expect spectacular, sustainable results.  People first, results second. A simple formula for performance and financial predictability. Advancing leadership can be the most important investment an organization can make in itself.  Dave's experience as a servant leader and a performance coach can offer rich insight for you and your organization. Insights that will pave the way for you to approach your optimal level of effectiveness. ",United States (Ohio),http://www.cainconsultinginc.com,NA,NA,NA,NA
